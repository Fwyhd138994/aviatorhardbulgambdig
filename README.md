The goal of Aviator is simple: bet on how long a plane will fly before
it crashes. The plane takes off with a multiplier of x1, and this
multiplier increases continuously as the plane flies. Players can cash
out their winnings at any time before the plane crashes, or they can
risk it all for a potentially huge payout.

## Tips for Winning at 1Win Aviator

-   **Set a Budget and Stick to It:** It\'s important to set a budget
    for yourself before you start playing Aviator. This will help you to
    avoid spending more money than you can afford to lose.
-   **Don\'t Bet More Than You Can Afford to Lose:** Only bet an amount
    that you are comfortable losing. If you bet more than you can afford
    to lose, you may end up chasing your losses and making poor
    decisions.
-   **Cash Out Early:** It\'s tempting to wait for the multiplier to get
    as high as possible, but it\'s important to remember that the plane
    can crash at any time. Cash out your winnings early if you\'re not
    comfortable with the risk.
-   **Use the Auto Cash Out Feature:** The auto cash out feature allows
    you to set a multiplier at which you want to cash out your winnings
    automatically. This can be a helpful way to avoid losing your
    winnings if you get distracted or if the plane crashes.
-   **Don\'t Chase Your Losses:** If you lose a few bets in a row, it\'s
    important to take a break and clear your head. Don\'t chase your
    losses, as this will only lead to more losses.
